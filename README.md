This is a work in progress that started during the Science Hack Day at the Academy of Science in San Francisco, California on Saturday 28th of September 2013.

The purpose of this repo is to add a visulizer to a claculator for n-th roots of complex number.

This is by no means a finished project (it is currently completely lacking any styling) but feel free to use any of it as suits you.

Someday features:
-an explanation of how you actually calculate nth roots
-coordinate system on the unit circle graph

Used here:
-Angular.js
-d3.js
